								<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio!</p>
								<p>As an undergraduate I studied architecture and was deeply moved by my final project: designing a cemetery in downtown St. Louis. This project shifted my interests away from building for its own sake and towards more human-centered design opportunities. After undergrad I served in the Peace Corps, Jamaica where I worked to get a Habitat for Humanity chapter started in my community. Following my service I pursued doctoral work in English Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. My dissertation explored how the inherent mixed-media conditions of cities demand new forms of participation and citizenship. After Detroit, my wife and I moved to East Texas where we worked at Wiley College, the oldest historically black college (HBCU) west of the Mississippi. I taught in the English Department and found, to my surprise, that I really enjoyed teaching freshman composition. My wife and I, along with several colleagues, planned and organized the first academic conference about hip-hop culture at an HBCU. We left Texas in 2015 and moved to be closer to family in Montana. I spent the last two years working on a farm and drafting a manuscript for a sci-fi novel about the internet of things.
								</p>
								<p>My studies in architecture provided a grounding in spatial interaction design, but  it was the my time in Texas and the baptism-by-fire of developing curricula that really shaped how I see interaction design at individual and group levels. I don't have experience with software tools or developing any digital interactive systems. Does the Microsoft Office suite count? But I have had experience with the design process from working with physical media and I'm familiar with the trial-and-error process from building and refining comfortable and safe spaces for people to learn and grow.
								</p>
								<p>My best learning classroom experience was architecture studio as an undergrad. While the coursework and faculty were engaging, but the space itself was the most memorable part of this experience. Over the course of the semester, the desks, walls, and ceiling became covered with our sketches, material studies, and projects (both successful and unsuccessful). Being surrounded by the physical manifestations of everyone's design process created an energy that made me eager to try new and different things.
